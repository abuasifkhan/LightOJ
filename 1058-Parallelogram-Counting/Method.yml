1) the midpoint of the diagonal of the parallelogram must intersect. <=> If there are two different segments intersect the midpoint, its a parallelogram. 
2) the use of a collection of point coordinates calculated midpoint of the discrete determined after appearing with a midpoint number k. 
3) For each k, use a combination of the number of formula k*(k-1)/2 the answer is a parallelogram
