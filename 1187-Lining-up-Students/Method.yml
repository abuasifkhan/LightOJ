Approach #1: nlon(n)
From input array i:(n...1) one can delete i-arr[i]th position in the segment tree. Thus have
the result.

Approach #2: O(n)
Initially ans=1 as first input is obviously 0. Here ans is the leftmost student's highest.

Let the value of input number i is A. If (i-A) is less than or equal to ans then if effects
the first student. So the ans increments to one.
