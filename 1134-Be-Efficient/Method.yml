lets check the 2nd test case:
the array is : 1 2 3 4 5 6
we have to find consecutive subsequences that are divisible by 3.
let start summing up the array modulo 3.
the array becomes :
array index: 0 1 2 3 4 5
main Array : 1 2 3 4 5 6
cumulative sum modulo 3 : 1 0 0 1 0 0
now think, for any 2 element which have same reminder we can get a consecutive subsequence divisible by 3.
for example :
index 1 and index 4 both have cumulative reminder 0.
so we can construct a consecutive subsequence from index 2 to 4 which is divisible by 3 (why?? simple math). in this case (3+4+5) = 12.
for every index we have to know how many same reminder we have encountered so far. We can do it by keeping an reminder array.
If we simulate the process for the array we get :
for index 0 : 0 sub sequence.
for index 1 : 0
for index 2 : 1
for index 3: 1
for index 4: 2
for index 5: 3
total 7.
observe.... sequences which are started from index 0....are not considered so we need to add the 4 zeros so the answer is 7 + 4 = 11.
