Think every number is a vertex, draw an edge between a and b if a and b is conflict.
Your goal is to find the maximum independent set. Since if a and b is conflict, 
if a has even number of prime factors, b must have odd number of prime factors. 
Thus this graph is bipartite. Bipartite graph maximum independent set is easy to solve.
