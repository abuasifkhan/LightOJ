Let, f(n,k) be the position of the survivor.
He cannot survive if we put him a*k positions (a>=0).
We have to shift the survivors position to
next_position+k. So the next position will be
f(n,k) = f(n-1,k)+k.

As the circle size is decreasing we have to modularize
the survivors position, so f(n,k)=(f(n-1,k)+k)%n
